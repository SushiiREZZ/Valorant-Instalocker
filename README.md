- Works separately from the game through the VALORANT API using [valclient](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valclient.py)
- Allows you to stop the application from waiting for pre-game whenever
- Allows you to switch between characters while instalocking
- Stops instalocking and sending API requests as soon as an error is found
- Clean and straightforward UI
- Fixed 3 second refresh limit to better prevent API abuse
- Agent banners, agent previews and other stuff i put in because memes

## ‚ùî How to use

- Start VALORANT and this app.
- Select any agent from the left-hand-side.
- Instalocking should begin automatically, that's it!
- Optionally, it's recommended to have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) installed. The .exe will simply open in your default browser otherwise, but it will still work.

<br>

## ‚ùå Windows protected your PC
The application might refuse to run because Windows will assume this is malicious.
<br>
The fix is pretty simple, click on `More Info` and click on `Run Anyway`
<br>
Is that safe? Yes, it is. Windows protects your PC because this is an unsigned executable from an external source. If you're feeling a little paranoid, you can build it yourself with the instructions below!

<br>

## ‚ùì Can I get banned?

Not likely unless you go around telling everyone you have an instalocker.
<br>
Even if Riot happens to somehow detect this, you will only recieve a 7 day ban for API abuse. That's still unlikely to occur and hasn't happened yet.
> With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, the anticheat shouldn't be triggered. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this method of exploit.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Support / Feedback:

- You can hit me up on Discord [@sushiirez](https://discord.com/users/1259628673045368842)

- Sometimes the instalocker waits for a few seconds after the loading screen to instalock, this is because it scans for the pre-game screen every 3 seconds. You can change the loop delay in the code for yourself.

#### Notes
+ I am also not responsible for **misuse** of this application, I do not condone using this and this only exists as an educational resource.
